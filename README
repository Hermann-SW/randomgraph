GRAPH algorithms
================

make

Should build the program  randomgraph.

The graph file format is that of the LEDA package from the MPI Saarbruecken,
Germany, of Prof. K. Mehlhorn.
The whole ugraph.h package is motivated by that packages datatype
UGRAPH; the difference are plain ANSI-C instead C++, fewer bug ( :-) ) and
more features!

randomgraph
===========

randomgraph                    --> gives short intro
randomgraph 10 -s 12345 -o t.u --> generates random maximal planar graph in
                                   file t.u with random generator seed 12345

Real random graph (seed is epoch time):

$ time ./randomgraph 1000000 -o t.u -s `date +%s`
